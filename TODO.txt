[x] Multithreading to analyze more items faster on a faster computer
[ ] Improve multithreading to analyze more items faster on a faster computer
[ ] Compute required ship cap for given per-jump profit
    3 methods of transport: 
        - if <340k m3 (OSLT) then can use GHSOL (applies in lowsec and highsec) to non-Jita (or +25mil with Jita fee)
        - if highsec, can use ~1mil/jump to pay (or base, which seems to be slightly less if collat low).
            freighter also allowed.
        - if lowsec, requires either DST (60k m3) or GHSOL. or BR (much smaller)
    Alternatively, we can just first print out the per-unit volume along with the total trade volume.
[ ] Rank trades by distance (or by profit per jump conditioned on ISK/m3 earned maybe?)
    Makes sense for haul, not trade.
[ ] Safe map to get safe short paths
[ ] Prettier reports
[x] Take into account distance from player
    - idea: if it's not possible to get to a region within MAX_JUMPS,
        then don't bother getting trades within that region.
[ ] Amarr <-> Jita trade profitable with hauler compute. Constrain with expected cost/jump,
    then get % return on capital (including haul cost + COGS + tax on sale + broker. Assume sale at mid + broker vs hit bid)
[ ] min volume of the trade if non-1
[ ] Allow for partial trades when  considering volume.
[ ] Allow for putting together trades in the same station + system.
[ ] Intel for recent jumps in system
[ ] When a trade is selected, live update the
    viability/status of the sell + buy orders
[ ] Check the name of the station and whether or not it's a Citadel (for scam)
[ ] Check min volume, alert when it's non-1
[ ] Check max cargohold subject to per-item volume, that becomes the new trade
    (we're never gonna take multiple trips)
[ ] report number of total hauls required
